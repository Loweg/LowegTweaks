# Loweg's Tweaks

## Vanilla tweaks
### Temperature Overhaul
Adds a new world creation parameter "Overall Stability" that determines the temperature stability of the world, including day/night temperature swings, seasonal effect, elevation effect, and more.

Changes the day/night temperature variation from a constant 7 degrees C to a variable based on the amount of rainfall on the map tile.

Default off.
### Work type shuffle
Shuffles around work types.

In the vanilla game, tasks like feeding patients are buried in the doctoring work category, even though the medical skill has no part in that task. This is also true of food delivery and wardening. This unnecessarily wastes the time of your most valuable colonists. This tweak moves all tasks related to feeding and moving patients into a new category called "nursing".

The tweak also combines the two small categories of growing and plant cutting into just growing, in order to save space.

Finally, crafting tasks are also shuffled around. The difference between crafting, tailoring, and smithing is not always helpful or clear. This tweak moves all labors that use the crafting skill into crafting, and unskilled labors into a new category called "laboring".

Has patches for Dubs Bad Hygiene and Rimatomics, RBSE, and CE. Has been tested with Vanilla Expanded and the Alpha series. Other mods that add smithing, tailoring, or plant cutting *work types* might break horribly.

Default off.
### Drug Fix
Fixes the drug crafting identity crisis.

In the vanilla game, drug crafting requires you to be capable of intellectual and crafting; uses a stove, crafting spot, campfire, or drug lab; and uses the intellectual or cooking skill. The way this is distributed is not necessarily intuitive (smokeleaf joint rolling uses cooking!). This tweak tries to fix this nightmare by making all drug crafting at a drug lab or crafting spot require intellectual and use the crafting skill, and all drug *cooking* at a stove or campfire (tea and wort) use the cooking skill.

Default on.
### Food poison rebalance
Makes it so that expert cooks will no longer poison your colonists due to "insufficient skill". They can still make tainted meals due to a dirty cooking area.

Default on.
### Floor affordances
Changes required floor affordances so that not all floors are heavy. Finally you can strew some straw around on sand or whatever. Makes straw light and wood medium. TODO: make carpets light.

Default on.
### Relic Diversification
Makes it so that apparel and some other things can spawn as relics.

No setting yet.
## Alpha Biomes
### Forsaken mood
The forsaken crags biome gives a negative mood debuff to colonists due to the sun being blotted out. This currently negates that if they have the biotech gene for dark vision.

Default off. Do not turn on unless you have Alpha Biomes loaded.

## Vanilla Expanded
### Capable Serketist
Increases the amount of permitted labors for the VME Serketist.

Default off. Do not turn on unless you have Vanilla Ideology Expanded - Memes and Structures loaded.
